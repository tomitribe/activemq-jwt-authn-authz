= Apache ActiveMQ with JWT based authentication and authorization

ActiveMQ has default support to authentication and authorization using file based approach (flat or xml) and using JAAS.
This example shows how to leverage JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users.
For more details, see blog

== Building

This project contains necessary API implementations for basic JWT usage.
When building this project, it will create a new ActiveMQ zip file with all required dependencies and classes.
This makes it easier to then run and test it.

Build the project with `mvn clean install`.
In the `target/` directory you will find a zip file named `apache-activemq-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip`.

== Running the example

You can unzip the produce zip file and run ActiveMQ as usual using scripts in `bin/` directory.
